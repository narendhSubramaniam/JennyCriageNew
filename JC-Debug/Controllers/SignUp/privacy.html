      <!-- <h1>Privacy Policy</h1> -->
      <div class="content_wrap">
        <strong>General</strong>
        <p>Many of the ways in which you interact with the Jenny Craig Web site
          (www.jennycraig.com and www.jennycraig.ca) (each, a “Site”) and the Jenny Craig mobile app
          (the
          “App”) allow us to learn about you. This Privacy Statement describes the type of
          information we
          collect from you when you visit our Site or use our App and explains how Jenny Craig may
          use and
          disclose such information, as well as your ability to control certain uses of it.</p>
        <strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong>
        <p><i>Information You Provide</i></p>
        <p>Jenny Craig collects information from you when you choose to share it with us to use our
          Site or
          App, create an online account with us, request information from us, sign up for
          newsletters or
          our email list, post in our chat rooms or message boards, or otherwise contact us. The
          categories of information we collect are your name, physical address, email address,
          telephone
          number, photo/image, gender, date of birth, health information such as your current weight
          and
          goal weight, food consumption, and measurements, and, if you are a Jenny Craig customer, a
          credit/debit card number or other financial information including information about your
          purchases from us, as well as your Jenny ID which is assigned upon membership. If you
          access
          your account through our website, or if you use our App, we collect your user name and
          password.
          In addition, if you allow the App to have your location data, that data is only used to
          help you
          identify the nearest Jenny Craig Center. It is not stored. You have the option of choosing
          whether or not to reveal personally identifiable information to us. If you do not provide
          all
          “required” information, however, some portions of our Site or App will not work properly
          for
          you, or you will not be able to register or access certain sections of the Site. In the
          event of
          a complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information about you from other
          parties or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about
          you in
          relation to that complaint.</p>
        <p><i>Information Automatically Collected</i></p>
        <p>We may use cookies, web beacons, log files, or other technologies to collect certain
          information
          about visitors to and users of our Sites and App, to deliver online advertisements that we
          think
          would be more relevant to your interests, and to monitor interactions with our emails and
          online
          advertisements. For example, we may automatically collect certain information from you,
          including but not limited to your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”)
          address, software version, and the domain name from which you accessed the Site or App. In
          addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and
          time you
          visit the Site or App, the areas or pages of the Site or App that you visit, the amount of
          time
          you spend viewing or using the Site or App, the number of times you return to the Site,
          other
          click-stream or Site or App usage data, and emails or ads that you open, forward or
          click-through to our Site or App.</p>
        <p><strong>Please note that our Sites use Google Analytics</strong>, a service that
          transmits
          website traffic data to Google servers in the United States. Google Analytics does not
          identify
          individual users or visitors, nor does it associate users’ or visitors’ IP addresses with
          any
          other data held by Google. We use reports provided by Google Analytics to help us
          understand
          website traffic and webpage usage. In addition, we use Flurry, another analytics tool, to
          track
          statistics about downloads, frequency of use of our App, ratings, and similar metrics.
          Flurry
          does not collect your personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p><i>Cookies and Other Tracking Methods</i></p>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your hard drive when you visit
          our
          Site. We use cookies or, in a limited number of cases, IP addresses or other tracking
          tools, for
          a number of reasons. For example, these tools may (a) allow you to store your password
          without
          having to constantly re-enter it; (b) help us to tailor our Site or a marketing message to
          better match your needs and interests; and (c) allow us to better understand how you and
          others
          use our Site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are the most
          popular.
          You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our
          Site
          may not work properly if you do. Check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to
          change
          your cookie preferences. To learn more about the use of cookies or other technologies to
          deliver
          more relevant advertising and to know your choices about not having this information used
          by
          certain Service Providers (defined below), please <a
                  href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" title="click here">click here</a>
        </p>
        <p>“Do-Not-Track” (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your
          preferences
          regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. When you choose to turn on the
          DNT
          setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, ad networks,
          plug-in
          providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your
          activity
          via cookies or other tracking technologies. We do not currently respond to Do-Not-Track
          browser
          signals or mechanisms. See the privacy policies of any linked sites with respect to how
          they
          respond to DNT signals, as their policies may differ from our own.</p>

          follows:
        </p>
        <ol>

        </ol>
        <p>Jenny Craig may share aggregate, deidentified information with third parties for our
          business
          purposes.</p>
        <p>Jenny Craig may sell or purchase assets during the normal course of our business. If
          another
          entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be
          transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is
          brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be
          sold or
          transferred to third parties. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable
          efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information provided through
          this
          Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.</p>
        <strong>Security</strong>
        <p>We take physical, administrative, and technical steps to safeguard the confidentiality of
          the
          information we collect from and about our customers and Site visitors. Although your
          privacy is
          important to us, we cannot guarantee our security measures. Jenny Craig encourages you to
          learn
          as much as you can about your privacy on the Internet.</p>
        <p>When you enter sensitive personal information (such as credit card information), we
          encrypt the
          transmission of that information using Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL).</p>
        <strong>Service Providers</strong>
        <p>Jenny Craig may contract with third parties to perform functions related to the Sites or
          App
          (“Service Providers”). Service Providers will have access to your information needed to
          perform
          their business functions, but may not use or share that information for other purposes.
          All
          companies with which we do business have agreed to be bound by the terms of this Privacy
          Statement and will not sell, rent, or otherwise transmit your personal information to
          third
          parties.</p>
        <strong>Public Forums &amp; Reviews</strong>
        <p>Any information that you may disclose on our Sites or App such as in blogs, on message
          boards, in
          chat rooms, or on other public areas on the Site or App, becomes public information.
          Please
          exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas. If you
          terminate
          your account, we may continue to show some of your content in anonymized form.</p>
        <strong>Links to Other Websites</strong>
        <p>The Sites and App may have links to third-party websites or applications, which may have
          privacy
          policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the practices of such sites
          or
          applications. Please note that if you provide any information on your own to third
          parties,
          different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of your personal information. We
          encourage
          you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.</p>
        <strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have a right to request from companies conducting
          business
          in California a list of all third-parties to which the company has disclosed Personal
          Information, as defined under California Civil Code Section 1798.80(e), during the
          preceding
          year for third- party direct marketing purposes. We will respond to one request per
          California
          resident per calendar year, according to California Civil Code Section 1798.83. You may

          your request, please attest
          to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address
          for your
          response. Please allow up to thirty (30) days for a response.</p>
        <strong>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy</strong>
        <p>Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. We do not direct the Sites or App to,
          nor do we
          knowingly, collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen. If we
          discover that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable
          information
          without verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information. If you are the
          parent or
          legal guardian of a child under 13 years old and you believe we have received personal
          information from your child, please contact us at <a
                  href="mailto:jennycare@jennycraig.com" title="jennycare@jennycraig.com">jennycare@jennycraig.com</a>
          to request deletion of that
          information.</p>
        <strong>Access to Your Personal Information</strong>
        <p>You may sign into your account or contact Customer Service (see “If You Have Questions”,
          below)
          or your Jenny Craig Anywhere Representative to update your profile information stored by
          Jenny
          Craig or request for data to be deleted.
        </p>
        <strong>Updates</strong>
        <p>Jenny Craig reserves the right to revise this Privacy Statement at any time, and may
          apply any
          changes to information previously collected, as permitted by law. If we change the Privacy
          Statement in a material way, we will provide notice to you by posting the updated Privacy
          Statement on our Site and App, updating the effective date to reflect that changes have
          been
          made. Your continued use of our Sites or App following any such change constitutes your
          agreement to follow and be bound by the terms as changed.</p>
        <strong>If You Have Questions</strong>
        <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Statement or the practices described herein, you
          may
